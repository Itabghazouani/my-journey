                            <h2>I/ Le Wagon Bootcamp</h2>
                            <p class="first-p-about">First of all, before the bootcamp, we had to spend many hours on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Codecademy</a> to learn the basics of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">CSS</a> mostly, and also a bit of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Javascript" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Javascript</a>. 24 weeks is a short period of time when it is about learning. So, of course, we didn't have a moment to waste. </p>
                            <p>Now comes the day we've start the bootcamp. We were a class of about 20 people, divided in three locations: Madrid, Lisbon and Barcelona. I'm living i Barcelona, and I won't lie, it is such a great environment to live and learn. Working, facing the beach is something I hope you all experience in your lifes, it's priceless. Anyway..</p>
                            <p>After we've swet our hardwares up, the bootcamp started and the pace was intense. There was so many concept to see...<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_if_else.htm" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Conditional Statements</a>, <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/docs/beginner-fr/xhtml/ch03s03.html" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Iterations</a>, <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Hash.html" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Hash</a>, <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Symbol.html" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Symbols</a>, <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.0.2/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Parsing</a>, <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Class.html" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Classes</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ruby-inheritance/" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Inheritance</a>, <a href="https://blog1.westagilelabs.com/m-v-c-architecture-of-ruby-on-rails-9712719a69ed" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">MVC Architecture</a>, <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/ruby-on-rails-crud#:~:text=CRUD%20stands%20for%20Create%2C%20Read,manipulate%20data%20stored%20within%20tables." target="_blank" class="about-article-link">CRUD and Models</a>, etc..</p>
                            <p>Le Wagon bootcamps are oriented Ruby and especially <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Ruby on Rails</a>. We've spent many times on this language and framework. And I won't lie I've learned a lot during these few months.</p>
                            <p>To validate the concepts we were learning, it was now time to work on projects. And all of us had to present an idea of project and it was submitted to a vote. Mine was called <span class="italic">"Shot Session"</span>". It was a social network for musicians. where it would have been possible to book a studio session and send request to other musicians dependings on needs and skills. Unfortunately (for the world), it has not been selected. It's still an idea I have and I want to do, it will come to life soon enough.</p>
                            <p>After this fail of my unborn baby, the class was divided in groups from 3 to 4 persons to work on projects. The first project I've worked on was called <span class="italic">"Strings and Things"</span>. It was an app where we could rent rackets privately. It helped us practice most of the concepts we've learned especially the MVC Architecture(Model-View-Controller) which is the most important part of a Rails Project because it is how the project is built.</p>
                            <p>A part of the languages and framework we were using, working on those projects helped us practice a lot of really important concepts, software and useful websites to work on a project, like github, figma, trello, learned how to use the terminal, create branches on a project, etc...</p>
                            <p>After 24 weeks, with my colleague Stephen, we had to present our final project. It was called <span class="italic">"Snap and Eat"</span>. An app to eat what you want when you know what you want. For example if you want to eat a Chicken Tikka Massala, you could have find any location in town where you could have enjoyed the dish.</p>
                            <p>I think we did a good job, especially if you take in count that the third element of the group had to give up on us for medical condition and we were 2 on this project when the other groups were 3 or 4. But we kept going, doing our best, and at the end the app was the way we imagined it and it's one of the best feeling in the world. It's like if you visualize a trick you wanna do with a pen or whatever, and it happens exactly how you wanted to. You start to look around to see if someone noticed. Yes, it's this feeling I'm talking about.</p>
                            <p>At the end, these 24 weeks at Le Wagon was a really great experience, it helped me understand that this is what I want to do with my life.</p>

                            <p>After that, personal obligations didn't allow me to start finding a company and work as a web developer. I had other priorities at that time and I had to put this journey between parantheses.</p>

                            <h2>III/ The Scrimba Journey</h2>
                            <p>And here comes the end of 2023. After my issues fixed and having again what I really want as first priority, I discover, without any expectation <a href="https://www.scrimba.com/" target="_blank" class="about-article-link">Scrimba</a>. I start a class about React, and I feel again this feeling of learning things I love, this feeling I've missed so much.</p>
                            <p>But to be 100% honest, I've also felt that I've lost some skills since then. Of course I did. Coding is not something easy and if you stop practicing, you'll lost it.</p>
                            <p>But it's no time to complaint about what I should have done differently. Life is what it is, it happened the way it did for a reason. So I've deceided to do the FrontEnd Career Path from the beginning.</p>

                            <p>Now it's been a bit more than a month that I've started, and I'm enjoying it like it was day 1.</p>
                            <p>I still have a long journey before it's done. I'll give you more information once I've been further in my Scrimba Journey. You already have a lot to read, don't be impatient, it'll come soon enough.</p>
